# Welcome to the Polycarbonate Blog

It's fascinating how technology shapes the way we live, work, and play. After years of tinkering with robots, diving deep into code, and spending countless hours exploring virtual worlds, I've decided to create this space where these passions can intersect and hopefully spark interesting discussions.

## Who Am I?

I'm Polycarbonate, a California-based engineering student with an insatiable curiosity for all things tech. By day, I work on bringing robots to life, and by night, you might find me either lost in an IDE, experimenting with synthesizers, or prototyping a new project. The name "Polycarbonate" comes from my love for materials science and engineering – much like the versatile polymer I'm named after, I believe in being adaptable and resilient while maintaining transparency in everything I do.

## What to Expect

You'll find detailed technical analyses of game mechanics that make your favorite titles tick, explorations of how modern music production intersects with engineering, and deep dives into robotics projects that keep me up at night (in the best way possible).

## Why Start Now?

In our rapidly evolving technological landscape, I've noticed how gaming, music, and engineering are becoming increasingly interconnected. From procedurally generated game soundtracks to AI-assisted music composition, from robotic musical instruments to games that teach programming – the lines between these disciplines are blurring in fascinating ways. This convergence creates a perfect opportunity to explore how these fields complement and enhance each other.

## Join the Journey

Whether you're a fellow engineer, a gaming enthusiast, a music producer, or simply someone curious about how things work, I hope you'll find something here that piques your interest. I believe the most interesting discoveries happen at the intersection of different fields, and I'm excited to explore these crossroads together. Expect 2-3 posts weekly.
